-- price_vnd reads the Size price through a correlated scalar subquery rather
-- than the column directly. The subquery returns the same value (it references
-- the already-joined row), but sqlc infers scalar subqueries as nullable, so
-- COALESCE yields sql.NullInt64 instead of a bare int64 that cannot scan the
-- NULL price of a required-Size Item whose Size has not been chosen yet.
